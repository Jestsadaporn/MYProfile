            Studying at Phothawattanasenee School. I got interested in computers about a year ago and started studying web development early on.
            Currently, I am also studying application development and IoT. I am still improving my skills, currently I am developing my Kotlin programming language 
            which is an extension of my Java learning. In the future, I have set a goal that when I find what I want to do as a career, I will always keep learning and improving myself.

                <p class="text-red-100 text-xl mt-4">I got interested in computers during the mini young Business IT Contest 2023.That competition gave me 
                    the idea to make the proposed project a reality. This was the starting point for me to practice developing websites and applications.
                    When I knew the path I wanted to start, I practiced and gained experience from various camps until I was confident in what I wanted to study, so I applied to this university.
